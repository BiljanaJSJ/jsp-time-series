# Notebook -- Hakai Institute Juvenile Salmon Program 2015 — 2017 Time Series

## Objectives:
The objectives of this manuscript are to:

* Introduce the Juvenile Salmon Program
* Describe briefly the methods related to field program 
* Present time series of data
* Point to papers that present deeper analysis of time series data

Draft Title: Hakai Institute Juvenile Salmon Survival Program — Monitoring and Research 2015 – 2017.

## Key Parameters Reported:

### Fish Metrics
* Salmon CPUE
* Spp. composition. Plot per week, per migration corridor
* Stock specific relative condition factor
* Lengths
* Weights
* Parasite loads

### Oceanography
* Chl a - Justin sorting out phaepigments...
* Phyto Biomass
* Nutrients - Depending on when they are analyzed 
* Zoop biomass	
* Temp CTD binning
* Salinity CTD binning

Overlap with other current analyses include
* Salish Sea Marine Survival Project: Run-timing, GSI, CPUE, Relative Condition, Lengths, Weights
* In-season reports: Sea lice, temp, chl a

New analysis (No overlap)

* Salinity, Nutrients, Zoop biomass, Phyto biomass. (Kang has these time series)

“Levings and Kotyk (1983) carried out two trawling surveys for juvenile sal- monids (chum, pink, coho, chinook and steelhead) in Discovery Passage and nearby channels in the north- ern Strait of Georgia. This was part of a sampling program established to examine the dispersal of wild chinook fry and juvenile marked chinook from re- lease experiments at Quinsam hatchery into the Campbell River (Fig. 1) estuary.”

“Upon leaving the Fraser River estuary, most smolts proceed along the mainland coast north- ward but some are flushed west across the Strait of Georgia by the Fraser River plume and tidal currents towards the Gulf Islands. Once among the Gulf Is- lands, these smolts turn north and migrate diagonally back across the Strait to join up with the smolts that have moved directly north from the river mouth (Groot and Cooke 1987).
